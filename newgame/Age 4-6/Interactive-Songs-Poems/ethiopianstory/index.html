                    <p>Once upon a time in the highlands of Ethiopia, there lived a clever farmer named Abebe.</p>
                    <p>One day, a lion started terrorizing his village, stealing goats and scaring children.</p>
                    <p>Abebe came up with a plan. He made a large, delicious-looking honeycomb and placed it near the lion's cave.</p>
                    <p>When the lion came to eat it, his jaws got stuck in the sticky honey!</p>
                    <p>The villagers then safely captured the lion and took him far away to a wildlife sanctuary.</p>
                    <p>From that day on, Abebe was known as the cleverest farmer in all of Ethiopia.</p>
